    <p>About 71 percent of the surface of the Earth is covered by the ocean, a vast body of saltwater. Oceanographers and nations around the world have traditionally classified the planet's ocean into four separate regions: the Pacific, Atlantic, Indian, and Arctic oceans. Oceanographers began designating the waters surrounding Antarctica as the Southern Ocean in the early 20th century, and National Geographic formally acknowledged this fifth ocean in 2021.
      </p>
      <p>The oceans contain a whopping 97 percent of the world's water. The weather, the temperature, and the availability of food for people and other animals are all significantly influenced by the ocean as a result. The ocean is still a mystery, in spite of its immense size and influence on every living thing on Earth. Humans have never charted, explored, or even seen more than 80% of the ocean. Compared to our own ocean floor, a much larger portion of the moon's and Mars' surfaces have been mapped and analyzed.
        </p>
      <p>Oceanographers have made some incredible discoveries previously, but there is still more to learn. For instance, we are aware that oceanic mountain ranges and deep valleys are similar to those seen on land. If Mount Everest, which is 8.84 kilometers (5.49 miles) tall, were placed in the Mariana or Philippine Trenches in the Pacific Ocean, two of the ocean's deepest regions, its peak would not even touch the surface of the sea. The Atlantic Ocean, on the other hand, is quite shallow because a substantial portion of its bottom is made up of continental shelves, which are portions of the continents that reach deep into the water. 3,720 meters is the average depth of the entire ocean (12,200 feet).
      </p>
      <p>The number of distinct species that live in the water is unknown. Some oceanographers think the number of species is decreasing as a result of the harm that pollution, rising sea temperatures, and other issues are causing to many marine ecosystems. Yet, oceanographers may be in for a lot more pleasant surprises in the years to come. Some scientists believe there are still between a few hundred thousand and a few million undiscovered species in the ocean, which means that more than 90% of the known species may still be undiscovered. There are currently about 226,000 ocean species known to science.
        </p>
      <p>Marcello Calisti, a National Geographic Explorer, has a love for learning more about the ocean's seabed and other ecosystems. Expert in biorobotics, he is creating an underwater exploration vehicle with "legged locomotion," which was modeled after how an octopus travels underwater. His long-term objective is to create robots that can investigate depths that are challenging for humans to access. Future oceanographers from all across the world will have lots to explore and learn because the ocean is so large.

  <h1 id= "russ-fam"> The French Royal Family</h1>

  <h1 id= "end-dynasty">Why Were the French Crown Jewels Sold?</h1>
    <p>Treasures that were formerly only owned by French kings and queens were made available to the highest bidder in 1887. The Third Republic government created a case to get rid of the gems by branding them frivolous, thus ignoring the historical significance of the collection. From a position of authority, a deputy proclaimed: "A democracy that is sure of itself and confident in the future has a duty to rid itself of these objects of luxury, devoid of usefulness and moral worth."
      </p>
    <p>The real reason for the government's indignation was something very different. With a slim margin of victory, the Third Republic took over in 1871 following the fall of Napoleon III. The restoration of monarchy by the Bourbons, Orleanists, or Bonapartists was a continuous worry for Republicans. If the diamonds stayed in the French treasury, they were worried that anyone whose family had worn them may suddenly claim ownership of them and the political influence they stand for.
      </p>
    <p>Undoubtedly, the collection's past served as a potent symbol of the monarchy. After being compelled to give up his personal jewels as ransom during an Italian battle, François I established the French Crown Jewels in 1525. Later kings increased their holdings. Louis XIV amassed a considerable diamond collection. The holdings were expanded by succeeding kings. Among the many big diamonds owned by Louis XIV was the 19.07-carat pale pink Grand Mazarin.
      </p>
    <p>The elegant Empress Eugénie, wife of Napoleon III, was the final person to leave their mark on the French Crown Jewels. She removed a few items from the collection and then gave the jewels to experienced jewelers. Numerous bows, stars, crescents, flowers, and neo-classical motifs were incorporated into the creations made with the stones for Eugénie. It was a stunning fusion of the most current fashion trends and the historical jewels that the empress treasured from her forebears.
      </p>
    <p>French jewelers were outraged when the government decided to auction their masterpieces and the country's wealth of valuable stones. In response, the Third Republic consented to designate a modest number of artifacts for state preservation. One stone they chose to keep was the 140.64-carat Regent diamond. Louis XV had made a purchase of it. Napoleon had given an Amsterdam banker the Regent as collateral to underwrite the expense of his army. He wore the diamond in the hilt of his sword after his triumph as a good luck charm. One brooch with two Mazarin diamonds from Eugénie's collection was kept. The Louvre or the Museum of Natural History are where the government kept everything.
      </p>
    <p>With this act of appeasement to the jewelers, the government made another choice that enraged the industry once again. Many jewels were dismantled and sold as segments and loose stones. The government then launched a massive promotion campaign.The collection was photographed by photographer Berthaud for a catalog that was delivered to potential bidders—diamond merchants, importers, and jewelers—all around the world. The press also received images. Even pictures from behind-the-scenes of Berthaud's photo shoot at the Ministry of Finance were published in the French magazine L'Illustration.
      </p>
    <p>As soon as the catalogs were handed out, jewelers began creating imitations. According to an article in the American trade magazine Jewelers' Circular, New York diamond importer Alfred H. Smith & Co. had a copy of the catalog and "cordially invited their friends and patrons to call and examine them." It was a code used to order their own set of the jewels.
      </p>
    <p>On May 12, 1887, the nine-session auction's final session opened in the state rooms of the Louvre, confirming the worst suspicions of the Third Republic. Members of the French royal family known as the Orleanists stepped up to bid on what they viewed as their inheritance. Ultimately, though, they were unable to outbid a strong assortment of jewelers who were anxious to buy the products for their customers.
      </p>
    <p>Frédéric Boucheron, a young jeweler, took home the Grand Mazarin. The tiara with a Greek key pattern that had been fashioned in 1864 received the highest price from Bapst, the jeweler of choice of Empress Eugénie. A piece created by Bapst in 1868 was picked up by a jeweler working on behalf of the British royal family.
      </p>
    <p>The American jeweler Tiffany emerged as the surprise winner of the auction, taking home more than two thirds of the items and instantly owning hundreds of years of history. Tiffany neatly packaged the history and sold its wares in custom-made leather boxes with "Diamants de la Couronne" stamped in gold on the top and "Tiffany & Co. New York and Paris" on the satin of the inside lid.
      </p>
    <p>In the 131 years since the French Crown Jewels were sold, only a few of the jewels have been visible to the general public. A piece of Eugénie's currant leaf bodice adornment showed up on the market in the 1930s at Paul Flato's store in New York.
      </p>
    <p>When opera singer Lucrezia Bori retired, the Metropolitan Opera in New York City gave her a gift on behalf of the organization. The rusted silver gem was dipped in platinum to reflect modern jewelry trends. In her will, Bori gave the institution back the brooch, which was displayed there all through the season. The decision to deaccession the treasure was made by the MET in 2014. A private collector purchased it from Christie's for $2.3 million.

      </p>
    <p>In 2015, the 19.07-carat Grand Mazarin, a dreamy light pink, reappeared in public. The gem sold for little over $14 million at Christie's Geneva in November 2017. The public is unaware of its whereabouts at this time.
      </p>
    <p>With the accession of Catherine II (1762-1796), the Russian Empire was able to wage wars and conquer new lands once more. Additionally, it put down a significant peasant uprising led by Pugachev. Catherine went toward the Black Sea while Peter the Great expanded Russia toward the Baltic. As a result, Russia had finally emerged as a major player, and it would now continue to conquer Siberia and other parts of Europe and Asia. The Romanovs were now regarded as one of Europe's most significant dynasties.
      </p>
    <p>Paul, Catherine's son, succeeded her. In order to prevent the spread of ideas from the French Revolution after assuming power in 1796, Alexander invited Russia to join the Second Coalition with England and Austria against France. Paul reunited with Napoleon Bonaparte in 1800 after being dissatisfied with England's apathy and broke diplomatic ties with London. Later, his officers turned against him, planning a plot to assassinate him in 1801. Alexander, Paul's son, succeeded his father.

  <h1 id= "what-kokoshnik"> What's a Kokoshnik?</h1>
    <p> The Russian word "kokoshnik" is translated. In the past, it was used to describe a headgear worn by married Russian women in specific regions of the nation. The size and shape of these classic kokoshniks varied slightly. Some of them were enormous, as seen in the image on the left, while others were smaller. However, kokoshniks generally had the same fundamental crescent shape. Many of them had ribbons fastening them at the back of the head.
      </p>
    <p>When the Romanov court started donning kokoshniks in the nineteenth century, they quickly gained popularity in the world of royal jewelry. To go with these classic Russian hat shapes, Russian tsarinas and grand duchesses copied the European tiara fashion, which had been popular at Napoleon's court in France. The huge kokoshnik headdresses that were a common feature of the traditional attire of many Russian peasants were typically transformed into smaller, crescent-shaped headdresses that resembled halos under the control of the Romanovs.
      </p>
    <p> The Romanovs added jewels to their kokoshniks, sometimes giving tiaras firm fabric backings to give them the necessary shape, and other times having tiaras fashioned in the same style as kokoshniks so that no additional fabric was required. You can see how a row of pearls was attached to a diamond fringe tiara worn by Tsarina Maria Feodorovna in the detail of the photo at the top of this piece to resemble the crescent form of kokoshniks. Like the four daughters of Tsar Nicholas II, unmarried Russian grand duchesses typically wore plain fabric kokoshniks without significant gems, though pearls were occasionally added.  Many grand duchesses added veils to their kokoshniks when they wore court attire.
      </p>
    <p>Due in part to the Romanovs' many familial connections to other royal houses in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the kokoshnik-style tiara gained popularity across Europe. Queen Alexandra of the United Kingdom asked for a tiara modeled after one of Tsarina Maria Feodorovna's kokoshniks as an anniversary present in 1888. Her great-granddaughter, Queen Elizabeth II, still dons the same diamond-set white and yellow gold kokoshnik tiara [4]. Other royal and noble families also possess kokoshnik tiaras that were modeled after those worn at the Romanov imperial court, such as the Bernadottes in Sweden and the Rosenborgs in Denmark.
      </p>
    <p>Because so many grand duchesses wed into different royal families, many examples of kokoshnik-shaped tiaras can still be found in European tiara collections today. Grand Duchess Olga Constantinovna of Russia, afterwards known as Queen Olga of the Hellenes, sent an emerald-studded kokoshnik to her new nation (see picture at right). The tiara has undergone changes throughout the years, but its current design still resembles its original kokoshnik design. As part of their wedding trousseaux, many Russian grand duchesses received diamond fringe tiaras that resembled kokoshnik headdresses. You can still see some of these tiaras on the descendants of these grand duchesses today in nations like Germany and Denmark (which they inherited from two Romanov duchesses, Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna and Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna). Because of its ties to the Romanovs, these fringe tiaras with halo-like adornments have also been referred to as tiaras russe.
      </p>
    <p>Other royals frequently bought kokoshnik tiaras from the Romanovs after the 1917 Russian Revolution. The spectacular Cartier sapphire and diamond kokoshnik tiara that Queen Marie of Romania purchased from her aunt, Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna ("the Elder") of Russia, was owned by the Romanian royal family until Princess Ileana, Queen Marie's daughter, sold it in exile in the 1950s. Originally made for Grand Duchess Elisabeth Feodorovna, a member of the Romanov family who was assassinated by the Bolsheviks, and sold to the Yugoslavian king by her niece, Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna ("the Younger"), Alexander I of Yugoslavia purchased the diamond and emerald kokoshnik for his new wife, Princess Maria of Romania, in 1922.
      </p>
    <p>So, ask yourself a few straightforward questions if you want to simply identify a kokoshnik tiara today. Is it in the form of a half-moon or a halo? Is the top of it noticeably curved? Is it connected to Russia or was it influenced by Russia? Any "yes" responses to any of those inquiries indicate that you are most certainly looking at a kokoshnik.

  <h1 id= "fre-crown"> French Crowns, Tiaras, & Other Treasures</h1>
    <p>For 300 years, Russia was controlled by the Romanov family. The finest jewelers in the world created some of the most intriguing crown jewels in history for the Romanovs during this time. The global leaders and ambassadors from Europe who visited the Russian royal court were deeply impressed by the superb bracelets, tiaras, diadems, crowns, rings, earrings, and brooches.

      <h3>The Crown of King Louis XV</h3>
        <p>TThe Louis XV crown is one of just six French crowns still in existence, along with others from the 19th century. The Crown Jewels were decided to be sold in 1885 by the French Third Republic. The Louis XV crown was preserved because of its historical significance, but glass in lieu of the valuable stones that it once held.
          </p>
        <p>The gilded silver crown with precious stone adornments was conceived by jeweler Claude Rondé and created under his supervision by Augustin Duflos in the Louvre's studio of Laurent Rondé, Claude's father and the king's jeweler.
          </p>
          <p><img src="fimages/louisxv.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="russaquatiara" style="float:left;width:310px;height:310px;">
          </p>
        <p>The Sancy served as the center of the apex flower at Louis XV's coronation in 1722, while the Regent was set in the midst of the frontal lily. After the coronation, replicas of the crown's valuable stones and pearls were used in its stead.
          </p>
        <p>The gilded silver headband is embellished all around with imitation diamonds and colored stones that have been carved into faceted shapes and mounted in both silver and gilded metal. Two rows of faux pearls are used to trim the edges. Eight fleur-de-lys in the shape of faceted cut imitation diamonds are put above the band. They alternate with appliqués made of openworked silver that are partially gilded and set with imitation diamonds and faceted cut colorful stones.
          </p>
        <p> The obverse and reverse of each fleur-de-lis are embellished with eight openwork gilded silver hoops that are set with faceted cut colorful stones and imitation diamonds. The arches form a dome that covers the crown; they are arched and connected at their tops to a top button. The top button is topped with a big fleur-de-lys made of faceted cut imitation diamonds and set on money. The base of the top button is embellished with two rows of faceted cut imitation diamonds framing a row of fake pearls.
          </p>
        <p>A crimson silk satin cap with gold thread embroidery is fastened inside the crown. Eight triangular pieces that have been stitched together form the cap. Three imitation faceted cut diamonds are stitched down the length of each of these panels in rows of decreasing size as they approach the top of the cap. The stones are set in silver mounts. This one has a faceted cut imitation diamond set in a silver setting that is sewed to the fabric as decoration. When the crown was restored in 2009, the purple cap mentioned in Le Mercure (1722, November, 1st) was tucked beneath this red cap.
          </p>
        <br>



      <h3>The Crown of Empress Eugenie</h3>
        <p>The Empress's crown is modeled after an imperial coat of arms from the First Empire and follows a design approach that is common in depictions of imperial crowns.
            The eight eagle-shaped arches were built of chased gold, while the other eight formed palmettes with a big central diamond. Two emeralds flank each palmette. Under a diamond globe embellished with a circle and a semicircle made of 32 emeralds and crowned with a cross made of six magnificent diamonds, the arches converge.
          </p>
        <p>A significant portion of the Crown diamonds were used for the Emperor's crown; fewer Crown diamonds were utilized for the Empress's crown. On the other hand, the Emperor owned the emeralds.
          </p>
        <p>In imperial symbolism, the eagle and palmette symbols frequently appear. Although it was supposed to be the same shape, the Emperor's crown has since vanished.
          </p>
          <p><img src="fimages/eugiene.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="eugenie crown" style="float:right;width:330px;height:310px;">
          </p>
        <p> Napoleon III intended to wow everyone in the globe during the Universal Exhibition in Paris in 1855, so he presented the Crown diamonds, which had been put back together especially for this event. With some of these diamonds, Alexandre-Gabriel Lemonnier (c. 1808–1884) was tasked with creating the crowns for the Emperor and the Empress. The Empress's crown, which is currently on display at the Louvre Museum, displays both the Second Empire's beauty and the skill of its jewelers.
          </p>
        <p>The jeweler Alexandre-Gabriel Lemonnier (c. 1808–1884), who had already been awarded the Council Medal and the Legion of Honor for his creations, was chosen to serve as the Prince-President (near future Napoleon III)'s jeweler following the London Universal Exhibition of 1851. He presents numerous gems to Eugénie in exchange for their union. In 1853, he was finally chosen to be the crown jeweler. J.-P. Maheu, a jeweler, was given charge of the general structure, while Lemonnier mounted the priceless stones. At the Universal Exhibition of 1855, both were awarded a silver medal for their efforts. The Fannière brothers, Joseph the carver (1820-1897) and Auguste the sculptor (1818-1900), created the models for the eagles. The best goldsmiths in Paris hired these two artists, who also won a silver medal.
          </p>

      <h3>Empress Marie Louise's Diadem</h3>
        <p>On the occasion of their marriage, Napoleon gave the Diadem to the Empress Marie-Louise, his second wife. The 1810-commissioned diadem was originally set with emeralds, which were switched out for turquoise in the middle of the 1950s. It was created by Paris-based Etienne Nitot et Fils. The diadem was one piece of a parure that also featured a necklace, earrings, and comb (disassembled), all made of emeralds, diamonds, silver, and gold. These items are currently in the Louvre. The diadem and its jewelry were left to Archduchess Elise, a Hapsburg aunt, by Marie-Louise.
          </p>
        <p>The jewels and a document proving its lineage were purchased by Van Cleef & Arpels in 1953 from Archduke Karl Stefan Hapsburg of Sweden, one of Archduchess Elise's relatives. The emeralds were taken out of the diadem by Van Cleef & Arpels and sold separately in jewelry pieces between May 1954 and June 1956. In a 1955 newspaper ad, the business offered: "An emerald for you from the historic Napoleonic Tiara..."
          </p>
        <p><img src="fimages/turqdia.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="marie louise Diadem" style="float:right;width:425px;height:350px;">
          </p>
        <p>Van Cleef & Arpels put the turquoise into the tiara sometime between 1956 and 1962. The turquoise diadem, along with the necklace, earrings, and comb, were on display in 1962 as part of a special exhibition on Empress Marie-Louise at the Louvre Museum in Paris. The diadem was acquired by Marjorie Merriweather Post from Van Cleef & Arpels and donated to the Smithsonian in 1971. The diadem* has an intricate arrangement of scrolls, palmettes, and medallions and is set with 1,006 old mine cut diamonds totaling 700 carats and 79 Persian turquoise stones totaling 540 carats.
          </p>
        <p>The shell of the diadem is made in a style that is remarkably reminiscent of Marie-Étienne Nitot's earlier creations. The diadem is a closed circle that is left-right symmetrical, widest in the front, and narrows toward the back. Silver and gold scrollwork, medallions, palmettes, and other floral patterns were all intricately used by Nitot. It resembles the tiaras and diadems he made for Princess Augusta of Bavaria and Marie-Thérèse, Duchess of Angoulême in this way. Originally, the front of the diadem's centerpiece was a single, 12-carat (2.4 g) enormous square-cut emerald that was oriented with one of its diagonals along the median line.
          </p>
        <p>Five lesser emeralds with rose-cut frames around a smaller oval-cut emerald that was set right beneath the main stone. A single layer of rose-cut white diamonds surrounds the center jewel. In addition to fifty-two smaller rose-cut and square-cut emeralds, which were also framed by a combination of rose-cut and brilliant-cut diamonds, twenty larger emeralds, each cut in the oval and briolette shape, were set into the symmetrical floral and scrollwork designs. A continuous single row of rose-cut diamonds is set into the band that serves as the diadem's basis.
          </p>
        <p>The Marie Louise Diadem contained a total of 1,002 brilliant-cut and 264 rose-cut diamonds of various sizes, weighing more than 700 carats (140 g), in addition to 79 Colombian emeralds "of the highest quality" that were mined in Muzo. Later, the 79 emeralds were taken out and replaced with an equal number of Iranian turquoise stones, most of which were cut as cabochons as opposed to faceted like the original emeralds. Total weight of the turquoise replacement stones is 540 carats (108 g).
          </p>
        <p>Since then, the diadem has been on display at the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of Natural History in the Janet Hooker Hall of Gems and Geology. In the 1990s, it was taken out of its dual exhibition with the Napoleon Diamond Necklace for a few months when the diadem was given to a conservator-restorer for repair. The old frame was taken apart, cleaned, and put back together while having any damaged pieces soldered. After making the transaction, Post asked if it would be feasible to replace the turquoise with emeralds once more, either synthetically or, if it were possible to get the original gemstones from their new owners, physically. However, the diadem's fragility prevented any further replacement.

      <h3>Empress Eugenie's Pearl Tiara</h3>
        <p>The women of the royal and imperial dynasties were renowned for wearing fine jewelry during all of the regal turmoil of nineteenth-century France. The nation's last empress is where the history of today's fairly stunning pearl diadem begins. From there, it travels through various royal houses before coming home.
          </p>
        <p>This tiara was initially a wedding gift, just like so many others. Emperor Napoleon III, Eugénie's husband, gave it to her. Although Alexandre-Gabriel Lemonnier created a brand-new piece, he had access to gems with provenance. The Duchess of Angoulême, the daughter of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette—remember her, possessor of stunning diamonds and emeralds?—and Empress Marie Louise, the second wife of Napoleon Bonaparte, had already worn gemstones, as did the new tiara. In total, this sparkler, which is made of silver, contains nearly two thousand diamonds and more than 200 pearls.
          </p>
        <p><img src="fimages/eugeniepearl.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Eugenie Pearl Tiara" style="float:left;width:410px;height:310px;">
          </p>
        <p>Throughout her husband's rule, Eugenie frequently wore the tiara, including on a state visit to Windsor Castle in 1855. Winterhalter had her depicted in it on several occasions. Even though the tiara was a wedding gift, it was nonetheless a piece of the French crown jewels, just like the emerald tiara that belonged to the Duchess of Angoulême. As a result, the tiara remained in France when Napoleon and Eugénie were banished to England in 1870. It went on display at the Paris World's Fair and the Louvre Museum before being sold at auction by the government, following in the footsteps of its emerald Angoulême cousin.
          </p>
        <p>But unlike the Angoulême tiara, which spent a century traveling around England, this jewel ended up staying in another royal collection for a century. As a wedding present for his new wife, Archduchess Margarethe Klementina of Austria, Prince Albert of Thurn and Taxis bought it in 1890.
          </p>
        <p>For decades and decades, it stayed with the Thurn and Taxis family. In the end, Princess Gloria, who was lovely and wild, wore it to marry the flamboyant Prince Johannes in 1980. While conducting an interview at her wedding reception, Gloria was caught on camera wearing the tiara.
          </p>
        <p>Following Johannes's passing in 1992, Gloria sold the tiara as part of the extensive, necessary liquidation of family assets. The Friends of the Louvre, who forked for more than a million dollars (USD) for the sparkler, were the buyer in waiting, just as they were for the Angoulême. After a century apart, the two tiaras were brought back together in France in the same magnificent mansion turned museum.

        <h3>Marie Antoinette’s Pearl Pendant</h3>
        <p>A diamond and natural pearl pendant that was predicted to bring in between $1 million and $2 million in pre-bidding instead brought in a staggering $36,165,090. "Queen Marie Antoinette's Pearl" broke the previous auction record for a genuine pearl with that enormous profit. A big teardrop-shaped pearl hangs from an oval-shaped diamond on the pendant, which also has a series of smaller diamonds strung together in a dramatic bow. The largest stone, which was detached from the other stones in the pendant and served as the necklace's clasp, according to Sotheby's, was once a part of the queen's three-strand pearl necklace.
          </p>
        <p><img src="fimages/mariepearl.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Marie Pearl Pendant" style="float:right;width:150px;height:200px;">
            </p>
        <p>The pendant is thought to have been among the valuables packed away at night in 1791 as the King and Queen made their escape from the surrounded armed revolutionaries and the besieged Palace of the Tuileries. The meticulously hidden gems were transported from Paris to Brussels and then on to Vienna, where they were placed in the custody of the Austrian Emperor, Marie Antoinette's nephew.
          </p>
        <p>The sole surviving child of the King and Queen, Marie-Thérèse de France, received the jewels much later. She left the current portion of the collection to her niece, the Duchess of Parma. Every portrait created before the royal family's incarceration depicts Marie Antoinette wearing diamonds, pearls, or other costly stones, demonstrating her penchant for ostentatious jewelry.

        <h3>The Regent Diamond</h3>
        <p>One of the most famous diamonds in the world, the 140-carat "Regent," is unique in terms of size, weight, and clarity. It is also considered to be "of the first water," or completely translucent. It was discovered in India in 1698, and its radiance was increased through cutting using the recently developed brilliant-cut method. At the time, it was the largest diamond known to man, but due to its astronomical price, not even the Sun King was willing to purchase it. Finally, in 1717, Philippe d'Orléans, Louis XIV's nephew and the Regent of France until Louis XV reached adulthood, bought it and gave it his name. Following that, the Regent diamond was adorned by all subsequent French monarchs, including the Empress Eugénie's tiara, Napoleon I's sword, and Louis XV's crown.
          </p>
        <p>Thomas Pitt, the English governor of Madras, was instantly interested in this stone when it was found in Golconda, India, in 1698. The diamond was cut in England and afterwards purchased at Philippe d'Orléans, the regent's, request in 1717. The Regent was more beautiful and heavier than any diamond ever known to Westerners. Because of its purity and the caliber of its cut, it continues to be regarded as the most beautiful diamond in the world today.
          </p>
          <p><img src="fimages/regent.png" class="figure-img img-fluid rounded" alt="Marie Pearl Pendant" style="float:right;width:150px;height:200px;">
              </p>
        <p>Thomas Pitt, the governor of Fort Saint-Georges in Madras, purchased the stone after its discovery in India in 1698 at a very high cost. Before being cut in England in 1702, the diamond weighed 426 carats at that time. The project took place between 1704 and 1706 and lasted two years. Tsar Peter the Great purchased many secondary stones from the project. The brilliant cut, which was created by a jeweler by the name of Harris, is the pinnacle of a process that may have started in Venice at the start of the 17th century. By using this method, it is possible to create perfectly aligned angles that give the light an unrivaled intensity and brilliance.
          </p>
        <p>Philippe d'Orléans, who served as regent of France from 1715 to 1723, persuaded the Council of Regency to purchase the diamond on June 6, 1717, taking advantage of the economic prosperity brought about by the John Law system under the Regency in France. Le Regent was the largest diamond then known in the West when it was purchased, and by 1719, it had more than tripled in value. It is still regarded as the most stunning diamond in the world today because of its "first water" color, which means that it is completely white and of nearly unquestionable purity. This gem remained one of the most priceless items of Crown property after the Regency and was used to ornament all crowned heads.
          </p>
        <p>When hosting the Turkish Embassy in 1721, Louis XV donned the Regent for the first time. On October 25, 1722, it was then momentarily mounted on Louis XV's coronation crown. The king started wearing the diamond on his hat shortly after his September 5, 1725, nuptials to Marie Leczinska; he continued this practice until the end of his reign. A new crown, like that of Louis XV, was fashioned for Louis XVI's coronation on June 11, 1775, and it was embellished with the Regent on the front.
          </p>
        <p>Louis XVI wore the diamond on his hat much like his grandfather did. It was stolen in 1792, discovered in a frame in 1793, and repeatedly pawned by the Directory and later the Consulate before Napoleon Bonaparte finally reclaimed it in 1801. Then, the goldsmiths Odiot, Boutet, and Nitot used it to adorn the First Consul's sword. Le Régent was added on Napoleon I's sword by Nitot in 1812 as one of its ornaments. It was first placed on the crowns of Louis XVIII, Charles X, and Napoleon III after the transition in power, and then it was placed on the Empress Eugénie's Greek tiara.

        <h3>Alexandra Feodorovna's Emerald Tiara</h3>
        <p>The tragic Romanovs' court has become the stuff of folklore and history in the nearly century after their passing, and the diamonds worn by the Romanova women have attracted a great deal of interest. Today's topic is an emerald tiara made for Alexandra Feodorovna, the nation's last empress.
          </p>
        <p> The emerald and diamond tiara was a piece of a bigger parure that Alix had purchased from Bolin and Faberge, two renowned Russian jewelers, in 1900. Oscar Piel, a jeweler for Fabergé, constructed a sizable matching devant-de-corsage, and Sophia Schwan, a jeweler for Bolin, made the parure's tiara and necklace. Due to its ability to create a complete circle, the tiara is also occasionally referred to as a "coronet" or "circlet." The tiara and necklace were "made in great haste" by Schwan, according to Stefano Papi in Jewels of the Romanovs, but he does not say why.
          </p>
        <p>Although some sources claim that the large emeralds used came from Colombian mines, the tiara's diamonds were sourced from South Africa. (For this reason, you may occasionally hear this referred to as the "Colombian tiara"). The emerald set in the center of the circlet is the largest; according to Papi, it is a "quadrangular sugarloaf cabochon emerald" that weighs about "23 carats." With flower accents positioned in the center of each scroll, the tiara features alternating ribbon and scroll motifs. The necklace also has ribbon and scroll patterns.
          </p>
        <p>In 1907, Nikolai Bodarevsky painted Alix wearing the tiara and devant-de-corsage from the parure. Although the tsarina may only be seen in this portrait sporting items from her emerald parure, we do know a little bit more about the circlet us ultimate fate.
          </p>
        <p>Sadly, the tiara and the necklace can be seen among the objects in the iconic Soviet "table" inventory depiction from 1922.  The majority of the diamonds on the table were either broken up or sold at auction. Since A.E. Fersman photographed and inventoried the emeralds in the mid-1920s, they have not been seen in public. It would be great to think that they are stashed away in a private collection, lurking somewhere in the shadows. Unfortunately, it’s more likely that it was dismantled.

        <h3>The Pink Diamond Diadem</h3>
        <p> Designed by St. Petersburg jeweler Jacob David Duval for either Elizabeth Alexeievna (Princess Louise of Baden, 1779-1826), the wife of Tsar Alexander I, or Maria Feodorovna (Duchess Sophie Dorothea of Württemberg, 1759-1828). Whoever it was intended for, it is amazing that considering its age, it is still presentable and essentially unmodified.
          </p>
        <p>The magnificent natural pink diamond, a 13.335 carat stone with more than 1,000 carats of diamonds surrounding it, is the focal point of the towering kokoshnik design. The stone was once foil-backed, which explains the variation in hue from image to image. The briolette-cut diamonds in the tiara's center are "en Tremblant," which means they are free to move, dangle, and toss prisms worthy of a disco ball around with each motion.
          </p>
        <p> It is the only authentic diadem that has survived the revolution and is still in Russia. Over 1,200 small round cut diamonds and 175 large Indian diamonds totaling a triangular headband in the Empire style. Large diamonds in the shape of a tear are suspended freely in the middle row and shine brilliantly with every head movement. Due to the extraordinary pink diamond, experts value this work of art as being priceless. Empress Maria Feodorovna wore the pink diamond tiara during her wedding, and afterwards, other brides from the royal dynasty also wore it.
          </p>
        <p>Given that it has the term "Russian Nuptial Tiara," it should be clear that the bride frequently wore it during royal marriages in Russia (along with a plethora of other imperial wedding jewels, including the wedding crown, because evidently one headpiece was insufficient). When Alexandra Feodorovna married Nicholas II in 1894, she was one of the last people to wear it (but not THE absolute last). The royal jewels were taken by the Bolsheviks after the assassination of the royal family in July 1918 and were collectively displayed in 1922. After that, many of the pieces were sold to affluent Americans and Europeans (more on that later). Some just vanished (like the wedding necklace made of diamonds). Additionally, some were kept by the Russian government and are secured in the Diamond Fund Museum at the Moscow Kremlin. And that is where the Russian Nuptial Tiara is currently located; it has been hidden there for almost a century.

        <h3>The Pearl Pendant Kokoshnik</h3>
        <p> One of the magnificent Romanov artifacts that was taken into custody was the Pearl Pendant Kokoshnik Tiara. However, we can follow a paper trail that indicates where it ended up. At least for a time. However, let us go back to the beginning.
          </p>
        <p>Bolin made the tiara in 1841 for Empress Alexandra Feodorovna, Nicolas I's wife, out of 25 of the finest pearls suspended from diamond arches. But the tiara was truly cherished by Marie Feodorovna, Tsar Alexander III's wife. So much so that she retained it in her home even though it was a piece of the Crown Jewels and not her personal tiara. In order to escape the eventual fate of her son and family (it is good to have family in high positions), Marie, by this point the Dowager Empress, fled to the Crimea during the Bolshevik revolution. King George V, her nephew, sent a ship to fetch her.
          </p>
        <p> She had only her "day jewels" with her when she first escaped because she had no notion that she would never come back. When Prince Felix Yusupov (you may recall him as one of the assassins who killed Rasputin) went to her house to get the remainder of her jewelry collection, he discovered that they were already gone. The Bolsheviks had gained possession of it.
          </p>
        <p>Contrary to many of the others, however (such as the Sapphire Wave Tiara, the Yugoslavian Diamond Kokoshnik Tiara, and Elizabeth Alexeievna's Diamond Kokoshnik Tiara), we can trace this tiara back to a Christie's auction in 1927 when it was purchased by jeweler Holmes & Co., who then sold it to the 9th Duke of Marlborough to give to his second wife Gladys.
          </p>
        <p> When Gladys passed away, the tiara changed hands once more in 1978, making its way through the London jewelry trade before ending up in Imelda Marcos' collection. The tiara still rests in a vault at the Central Bank of the Philippines with countless other jewels that were purportedly bought with money from the Philippine government, awaiting their ultimate fate.
          </p>
        <p>There have been rumors that the Philippine government will either exhibit the seized items, including The Russian Pearl Pendant Kokoshnik Tiara, to boost tourism or will auction them off.
          </p>
        <br>

        <h3>The Yugoslavian Diamond Kokoshnik Tiara</h3>
        <p> First cousin to King Alexander, Prince Paul of Yugoslavia, wed Princess Olga of Greece and Denmark in 1923. Given that Olga was related to almost all of the significant royal families in Europe, this marriage was especially advantageous for Yugoslavia. Her mother was Grand Duchess Elena Vladimirovna of Russia, the daughter of the formidable and jewel-obsessed Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna, the Grand Duchess Vladimir. Her father was Prince Nicolas of Greece.
          </p>
        <p>Elena had received the customary jewel-encrusted bridal gifts fit for an Imperial Russian Grand Duchess, including this rumored Cartier-made Diamond Kokoshnik Tiara. On the occasion of her daughter Olga's wedding, she in turn gave her this tiara.
          </p>
        <p> Tragically, Prince Paul took over as regent of Yugoslavia after King Alexander was killed in 1929. As a result of Queen Marie's retirement, Princess Olga assumed the role of first lady in practice.
          </p>
        <p>Princess Olga wore her Diamond Kokoshnik for numerous official pictures and significant international events, including the Coronation ball of George VI, in addition to her Boucheron Tiara and her Ruby Olive Wreath Parure.
          </p>
        <p>Prince Paul and Princess Olga fled Yugoslavia in 1945 and went into exile, but because Olga was closely related to other European royals who were still in power, the tiara was nevertheless visible at significant occasions. At her son's 1955 nuptials to the Italian Princess Maria Pia of Savoy, Princess Olga wore her kokoshnik.
          </p>
        <p>Princess Olga was photographed wearing this tiara during the Pre-Wedding Gala for the 1962 wedding of Princess Sofia to Juan Carlos, although there looked to be visible gaps in the center. Some people were led to believe that the central hanging diamonds had been sold to pay for the family's support while they were in exile because of this. However…
          </p>
        <p>Again, Beth at the History of Famous Jewels and Collections Message Board is to credit for this information; it appears that the tiara had only been modified to raise the top portion.
          In keeping with family custom, Princess Olga gave her new daughter-in-law the tiara (or at the very least, let her borrow it). Its current location is unclear.
          </p>
        <br>

        <h3>The Sapphire Wave Tiara</h3>
        <p> When it comes to the Romanov crown jewels, there is a lot of mystery. But it stands to reason that we have long been aware of all of those mysteries. But in 2012, a brand-new puzzle was revealed. Several long-forgotten Romanov Jewels, including the Sapphire Wave Tiara, a magnificent diadem.
          </p>
        <p>Let us begin the mystery's story at the very beginning. He was a mineralist and gemologist by the name of George F. Kunz, and it is in his honor that the gemstone "Kunzite" bears his name. George worked for the United States Geological Survey, an organization, when he passed away in 1932. At the age of 23, he also held a vice president position at Tiffany & Co. The secret was hidden away for many years in the USGS library in Reston, Virginia.
          </p>
        <p> However, it was found in George's bequeathed papers in 2012 that there was a 1922 publication called The Russian Diamond Fund. Outside of being a book, the Russian Diamond Fund is a Kremlin-run institution that holds the remaining Russian Crown Jewels. But in 1922, not long after the last Tzar and his family had been killed by the Bolsheviks, the Diamond Fund was brimming with Romanov artifacts. And this publication has information about them. Interestingly, they were not included in Russia's Treasure of Diamonds and Precious Stones, a 1925 book that was thought to have the most thorough catalog of the Romanov Crown Jewels. Before now.
          </p>
        <p>The Russian Diamond Fund was one of Kunz's copies, and inside it, researchers found four jewelry items that had never been published before. A sapphire bow brooch, an emerald and diamond necklace, a sapphire and diamond bracelet, and The Sapphire Wave Tiara. The tiara included nine seemingly impossibly huge sapphires that were encircled by wave-like diamond loops that each ended in diamond drops. It was so peculiar that some may even argue the tiara had an oceanic feel to it. The tiara was recognized as having belonged to Marie Feodorovna, who you may recall as Alexander III's wife and the mother of the last Tzar of Russia, in a drawing in Geoffrey Munn's book Tiaras: A History of Splendor.
          </p>
        <p>The tiara was commonly worn backed by a traditional kokoshnik headpiece covered in cloth and capped with a row of diamonds (possibly from a diamond rivière necklace). In addition to appearing in Konstantin Makovsky's photograph, Marie wore the tiara to the wedding of Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh, and Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia in 1874. However, it remains a mystery as to where the tiara might be right now. The USGS research team was able to ascertain that the tiara and other diamonds, excluding the brooch, were lost to history after being sold at auction in 1927. They could have been disassembled, sold, and used to make other pieces by the Bolsheviks a long time ago.
